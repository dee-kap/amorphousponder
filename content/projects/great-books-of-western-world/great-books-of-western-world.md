# The Great Books of Western World

Reading The Great Books of Western World is a herculian task. Not something that you can just glide through. Understanding the magnitude of this undertaking, I am giving myself <mark>10 years</mark> (starting in November 2024) to read all <strong>54 volumes</strong> of this great compilation.

On this page, I will keep track of my progress and post links to the notes I write as I read the books.
