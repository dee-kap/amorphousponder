# My Plan For Reading The Great Books of Western World

The Great Books of Western World comprises of approximately 2500 years of selected knowledge compiled into 54 volumes. Reading the books is a great way to self educate one self in liberal arts. As an aspiring generalist, I foresee great value in it for myself and I'm a bit too excited to go through these volumes. 

It is no surprise that I will need more than just excitment. I will need a reading plan to extract the maximum value for the effort I will put into this project. 

There are three recommended ways to approach The Great Books:

1. Chronological
2. Cyclical
3. Thematic

My plan is to read the volumes chronologically starting with of course [The Great Conversation](vol-1-the-great-conversation/index.md) which is volume 1 and then over the years get to the final volume 54 which is Sigmund Freud. In addition to understanding the ideas, I would also like to understand how they developed over the centuries. By reading the books in chronological order, I should be able to achive my goals.
