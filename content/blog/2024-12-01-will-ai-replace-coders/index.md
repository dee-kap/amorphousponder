I'm a programmer, a coder, a bit shifter and like many other, I have been thinking about what AI means for me as a computer programmer (the term I prefer). Will AI replace us programmers? Will the technology mature to a level where humans will not be required to write any code? What will happen to the jobs? What will be the jobs for the programmers in the future?

For an answer to all such questions, I turned to ChatGPT. This is what I asked.

Do you think you will replace coding jobs in the future?

And ChatGPT replied with this.

<blockquote>
It's unlikely that AI will completely replace coding jobs in the near future, but it will certainly transform the role of software developers. Here's why:

AI as an Assistant, Not a Replacement

    1. Augmentation, Not Substitution: Tools like me are designed to help developers write, debug, and optimize code more efficiently, not to eliminate the need for skilled coders.

    2. Human Creativity and Problem-Solving: Coding isn't just about writing lines of code—it's about understanding complex problems, designing architectures, and innovating. These require creativity, domain knowledge, and human intuition, which AI complements but doesn't replicate.

Areas of Transformation

    1. Routine Tasks: AI can automate repetitive tasks like boilerplate code generation, basic testing, and syntax corrections. This reduces the need for manual grunt work but shifts the focus to higher-value activities.

    2. Specialization and Oversight: Developers will increasingly focus on specialized skills like understanding business requirements, data science, and system architecture, as well as overseeing AI systems.

    3. New Opportunities: As AI becomes integrated into more applications, it creates a demand for developers who understand AI and machine learning principles.

Long-Term Outlook

    1. Skill Evolution: Coders will need to adapt by learning how to work alongside AI and leveraging it as a tool. Understanding AI, data ethics, and algorithm bias will also become essential.

    2. Human-Driven Roles: Leadership, strategic thinking, and empathy in product development—roles that require human-centric decision-making—will remain irreplaceable.

So, while AI like me is reshaping the field, coding jobs are evolving rather than disappearing. Those who embrace these changes will likely thrive in a future where humans and AI collaborate effectively.

So according to ChatGPT, I don't need to worry too much about nothin.

I knew this already but one can't be too careful. Kinda figured this out recently when I had to debug an issue which required some troubleshooting chops which only come after years of experience and a thorough understanding of the systems. The issue was such that it crossed application boundaries and I was helping a colleague find the source of the problem. After spending few hours, going over the logs and investigating message flow, I was able to find the cause of the bug.

At the end of it, both of us concluded that there was no way this could have been found by any AI worth it's prompts. Maybe in 10 or so years but not now.

The moral of the story is that there is nothing to worry about for at least 10 year.
