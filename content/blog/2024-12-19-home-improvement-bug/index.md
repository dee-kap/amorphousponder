For a change this is not the kind of bug I mostly deal with.

I was browsing Amazon during Black Friday sale and saw a Bosch electric screwdriver for a decent price. I bought it thinking that it will be a good tool to have around for screwing needs. The first thing I used it for was to change door hinges on a kitchen cabinet to soft close hinges. It was not at all hard and the tool made the job quick easy. This gave me confidence that I could do such things around the house. It also kicked off an interest in doing things around the house.

Next project I took on was painting of the backyard fence. Jumping from inserting a couple of screws to paint a fence is a big leap but I was ready for the challenge.
