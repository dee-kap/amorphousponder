It was more than 20 years ago when I went to RSL for the first time. It was for dinner and I vividly remember when at 6pm everything stopped for silence which is a way of paying respect to the soldiers who fought for the country in many wars. It was a moving experience the first time and it remains profound every time I visit RSL.

RSL which is short for Returned and Services League of Australia are local clubs found in majority of surburbs across Australia. They are a desirable place to have a meal or drinks. Every now and then, we as a family like to visit our local RSL for a meal.

> They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old; 
<br/>
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
<br/>
At the going down of the sun and in the morning,
<br/>
We will remember them. 
<br/>
Lest we forget
