 # The Golden Road: How Ancient India Transformed the World by William Dalrymple

 There are certain books that change the way to look at history. This is one of those books. 


 I have few other books written by William Dalrymple and after reading The Golden Road they have pushed up the stack and I plan to read them soon.
