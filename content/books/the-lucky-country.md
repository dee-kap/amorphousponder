 # The Lucky Country: Australia in the sixties by Donald Horne


<img src="../../public/images/covers/the-lucky-country.jpg" class="book-in-post-left" alt="The Lucky Country">

When it comes to success of a book, The Lucky Country is amongst the top . The title of the book became a nickname for Australia. I don't think there is another such example anywhere in the world. Published in 1964, The Lucky Country covers many different aspects of Australia. Without going into details of the range of topics covered in the book, the author touches the surface enough to make it interesting. At the end of every chapter, I wanted to know more.

There are many quotable sentences in the book, but this just stands out.

> Australia is a lucky country, run mainly by second-rate people who share its luck.

I would highly recommend this book if you want to understand Australia of sixties, not in entirety but small parts of it.
