 # The Lucky Country by Donald Horne

The Lucky Country is as sticky as a book can get. The title of the book became a nickname for the country. I don't think there is another such example anywhere in the world. 

The book was published in 1964 and as expected plenty has changed over the decades. The main idea(s) of the book will still resonate with Australians.

I would highly recommend this book if you want to understand Australia, not in entirety but a part of it.
