I have known about Einstein from a very young age (around primary school), I knew that he was a famous scientist. During high school I discovered more about Einstien's scientific work most around Relativity. I was familiar with the words but had no idea what they meant. I'm not sure that I still understand Relativity but I do understand more than I did. 

After reading the biography of Einstein by Walter Isaccson, I have gained a deeper insight into Einstein's scientific work, his political views and his personal life. 

This book was a page turner for me.
