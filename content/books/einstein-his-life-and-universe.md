During my primary school years, I knew that Albert Einstein was a famous scientist. In high school I discovered more about Einstien's scientific work and heard the term Relativity and a few others. I was familiar with the words but had no idea what they meant. I'm not sure that I still understand Relativity but I do understand more than I did. 

Eienstein was a multifaceted person who was one of the smartest people to ever live. His discoveries changed the way we understand our world, the world beyond us and the entire universe. I only wish that I knew enough Physics to understand his works. Maybe some day I will get into studying it and enjoy the joy of understanding  Special Theory of Relativity, General Theory of Relativity,  The Photoelectric Effect, Wave-Particle Duality, Brownian movement, Quantum Theory of Light, Avogadro's Number, the relationship between mass and energy, Bose-Einstein Condensate etc.

After reading the biography of Einstein by Walter Isaccson, I have gained a deeper insight into Einstein's scientific work, his political views and his personal life. I now know about how difficult his personal life was, his relation with his first wife Mileva Marić who was instrumental in his early successes and was a companion in his younger days. His struggle with his children who often felt neglected and later his difficulties in coming to terms with Quantum Mechanics (he never did).

I got introduced to Spinoza and would like to read more about his philosophy on religion and god.

The book also motivated me to work on my focus which I often feel is not up to the mark.
